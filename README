Requires libjack library and headers to compile, and a running jack server when it is launched.

Just type make to build (for some reason -j n options make it not build, a better build system will be put in at some point).
This currently only operates on trial.pts, this will not remain the behaviour, it was for testing of a new feature.

The headergen.py script is for generating the headers (surprisingly), and is intended for use by developers, the included ones should work.

The makegen.sh script is for generating the Makefile, and is intended for use by developers, the one included should work if you just want to have a play.

To use send it any midi event and it will make a noise (this will get fancier).

Requires libjack library and headers to compile, and a running jack server when it is launched.
Python is a build time dependancy (it is used to generate header files), but it is not used during runtime.

Just type make to build (for some reason -j n options make it not build, a better build system will be put in at some point).
This currently only operates on trial.pts, this will not remain the behaviour, it was for testing of a new feature.

The makegen.sh script is for generating the Makefile, and is intended for use by developers, the one included should work if you just want to have a play.
